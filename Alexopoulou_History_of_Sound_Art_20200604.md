 Thanks very much Catherine and thanks to Robert Wylin   and Martyn Lucy for inviting me to give that talk today. The occasion for the talk is I think the first sonic intervention into the Barnes collection a piece by Andrew Horinck called unbounded histories, which I haven’t yet got the chance to experience , hopefully I will tomorrow. But one of the things, I think, that piece as I understand it that highlights is the fact that sound can maintain a very sort of powerful presence in the space without sort of leaving a trace and without well reseat of  remaining invisible.  So these are the things I’m gonna talk about a little bit today.  

What I wanna do is give an overview of what’s called sound art and I’ll talk a little bit about that in a moment and to consider some of its historical and contemporary variants, so I’m gonna talk, I’m gonna give a broad overview and then I’ll look at some sort of contemporary versions of the things that today go under that name. So before I begin I wanna lay out two caveats. First, sound art. That term is a thorny label, it’s a label about which many artists and some curators and credits   have misgivings. These reservations were sort of bluntly voiced   by sound installation pioneer that I will come across later on in the talk Max Neuhaus, who was writing a catalogue essay, actually a wall text for an exhibition in New York in 2020. And despite the fact that he was conscripted under this.. as a sort of exemplar of sound art, he declared, you know.. sound art that .. dismissed the phrase, sound art as a category mistake. His analogy was: it’s as dumb a title as grouping together stupid still sculpture and still guitar music and calling something still art. Right? It’s just that too many things fall under that category and it’s kind of no sense … term.   

So this brings me to the second caveat which is that an enormous number of things goes under this title. Some people call it electronic music sound art, installations, sculptures, paintings, drawings. We’ll come across all those things in a minute. And so the question is: what constitutes.. what is this thing if so many things under its name. How does one distinguish it from other things the make sound, sonic things. How was distinguish it from other sort of genres and practices and visual arts. So I’m gonna try to respond to these words, not directly now but as we go on. Let me just say initially that I don’t think there is any sort of.. I don’t take sound art as if to be a genre that is distinguishable from music and any kind of rigorous way. I do think though that it helps to label something and make distinctions in the same way that say that distincition between theater and performance, which again there is no rigorous distinction between these two, but I think it marks out to helpful.. helpful difference. And I also think that.. as we see.. or at least.. as I hope we see that I think it points to something interesting that happen over the past…. Of 21st century in relationship between music and sound. And.. so to me, it points to some important differences that however are not sort of clean and hard and fast. And I suppose that the last caveat that I’ll give is that I’m gonna kind of like stew………. Sort of the broad sweep History and I’m gonna play a bunch of little things nothing for very long, that I could drive some of you crazy. Maybe some of you ‘ ll be really happy with some of the things I present, I resent quickly. But If you wanna talk more about any of these things, or you wanna hear more or whatever, we can do that at the end. So let me.. I’m gonna go to.. Before I begin with ort of sound art proper, I think it’s important to give some kind of pre history.. Partly, because really important things prepare the way for what gets called sound art which is often said to have begun in the 60’s with figures like LeMonte Young and Max Neuhaus and Alvin Lucier, but… so I wanna begin way earlier.. I wanna begin with Edison back in 1878 and the reason for this is that first of all sound recording, the art of sound recording and this is the second.. I think of the variations of his photograph. Sound recording made it possible to install sound, to have sound be something that could take place in a space without performers. Right? Now again.. some sound artists are perfectly performative but a lot of what I’ve been talking about has to do with a kind of installation practice that sort of ..is a recorded alternative to performance.  

The other thing that I think it is really important, and this is kind of crucial to this history, is that.. I mean this is really obvious when you think about it.. but it really had a profound impact on history and sound and music in the 20th century. And that’s that the sound recording allowed, didn’t distinguish among the variety of sounds that could be heard, right? S that sound, recording sounds, phonograph and audio recording could register the sound of a voice, the sound of a piano, the sound of a bird song, of machines, of wind.. all of these things were.. so the recording apparatus made no distinction among them, which is really crucially important for how artist came to think about.. sound and its relationship to music. Okay?  That artist pretty quickly registered this fact that none musical sound could be received and appreciated aesthetically.. One of the earliest and most important of these was Luigi Russolo who in this great 1930 manifesto, ‘the art of noises’, called on, and of course Russolo was a feauturist painter, not in fact the composer, but a painter.. And if you know anything about the feauturists, they were big into large grand scale proclamations and of relegating all of the past that has been in the history.. So Russolo said you know that the contemporary orchestra is useless… the traditional music instruments are worthless.. we now need a new art form, I’m gonna call this the art of noises, and we need new instruments to make that happen, right? So in this text, in this manifesto.. This is the longest of the quotations I have.. I’ll just quickly read it. So, musical sound is too limited in its variety of timbres. We must break out this limited circle of sounds in concrete and infinite variety of noise sounds. Let us cross a large modern capital with our ears more sensitive than our eyes. We will delight in distinguishing the eddying of water or air or gas in metal pipes, the muttering of meters that breath and pulse with an indisputable animality, the thriving of , the bustling of pistons, the speraking of mechanical saws, the tracks, the cracking of whips, the flapping of awnings and flags..
